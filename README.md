<h1>Heading level 1</h1>

I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on. 

I just love **bold text**.

Try to put a blank line before...

> This is a blockquote

...and after a blockquote. 

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item 

* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item 

1. Open the file.
2. Find the following code block on line 21:

        <html>
          <head>
            <title>Test</title>
          </head>

3. Update the title to match the name of your website.

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).
